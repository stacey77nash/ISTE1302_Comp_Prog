"""
Tonight's the night
Let's live it up
I got my money
Let's spend it up
Go out and smash it
Like, oh my God!
Jump off that sofa
Let's get - get off
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out
And just lose it all
I feel stressed and
I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out
And losing all control
Fill up my cup
Mazel tov
Look at her dancin'
Just take it... off
Let's paint the town
We'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof
And then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
Let's do it, and do it, and do it
Let's live it up
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it")
